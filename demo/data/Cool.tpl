To achieve a good visual positioning of nodes, Morcego has an internal physical simulation to balance the graph.<br /><br />

The hexagon you see here is a reproduction of an experiment made during the development of the physical model.<br /><br />

Play around with the nodes. If you build a cool shape by editing the xml files under data/ dir, please send it the developmers at morcego-dev@arca.ime.usp.br, we'll be pleased to pack your experiments with next version!
