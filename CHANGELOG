Morcego Changelog
------------------

All developers are invited to add relevant changes in this file as they
apply them to the SVN source. You can optionally include an identifer
for the origin of the change (author, submitter, anyone involved) but
that's not so useful as the cvs log knows who adds what when.

Use the following tags to distinguish changes :
* [NEW] apply if something new was added in morcego
* [MOD] is an enhancement; not really new but makes things work better
* [FIX] can be used for bug fixes of any sort

Version 0.5.0

In this version graph internal structure and xmlrpc transport were refactored so that
links can have properties as nodes do. Now it's possible to represent different kinds
of nodes and relations and have its physical properties to reflect some real world value.

Visualization impression also got better with a more flexible camera adjustment.

[NEW] Xmlrpc transport version 2, supporting properties for links
[NEW] Configurable node and link types
[NEW] Types "Dashed", "Directional" and "Bidirectional" for links
[NEW] Types "Text" and "Image" for nodes
[NEW] Mouse over on link shows description
[MOD] More flexible camera adjustment system, controlled by minCameraDistance option
[NEW] Configuration option centerNodeScale
[MOD] Config variable linkColor renamed to defaultLinkColor and transportClass renamed to transport
[MOD] New default values for windowWidth, elasticConstant, punctualElasticConstant and feedAnimationInterval
[MOD] Configuration options adjustCameraDistance removed, viewHeight and viewWidth got obsolete
[FIX] Balancer would not awake if it stops while user holds a node
[NEW] Navigation controlled by javascript

Version 0.4.1

[FIX] Node title was being ignored

Version 0.4.0
-------------

In this version code was extensively refactored. Greatest improvement is the
new physical model that gives graph a much better visual impression.

New configuration vars (check README for meaning):

     - frictionConstant, new Float(0.4f));
     - elasticConstant, new Float(0.5f));
     - punctualElasticConstant, new Float(1f));
     - eletrostaticConstant, new Float(1000f));
     - springSize, new Float(100));
     - nodeMass, new Float(5));
     - nodeCharge, new Float(1));
     - loadPageOnCenter, new Boolean(true));

These are not used anymore:

     - originX
     - originY
     - originZ
     - universeRadius
     - maxNodeSpeed
     - linkedNodesDistance

Changes:

[ADD] physical model to balance graph
[ADD] support for description box on mouse over
[ADD] Morcego and Arca logs, optional
[ADD] support for different transport layers, only XmlprcTransport available 
      by now
[ADD] option to have camera distance relative to nearest node instead of
      center, default.
[ADD] option to open target page on every navigation, default
[MOD] nodes pop always behind center node, to avoid hanging while rendering
      very big nodes
[FIX] graph instability in some cases
