Morcego Changelog
------------------

All developers are invited to add relevant changes in this file as they
apply them to the SVN source. You can optionally include an identifer
for the origin of the change (author, submitter, anyone involved) but
that's not so useful as the cvs log knows who adds what when.

Use the following tags to distinguish changes :
* [NEW] apply if something new was added in morcego
* [MOD] is an enhancement; not really new but makes things work better
* [FIX] can be used for bug fixes of any sort

Version 0.4.1

[FIX] Node title was being ignored
[NEW] Configurable node type. Default type defined by nodeDefaultType
[NEW] "Text" node type, only show node title and no image

Version 0.4.0
-------------

In this version code was extensively refactored. Greatest improvement is the
new physical model that gives graph a much better visual impression.

New configuration vars (check README for meaning):

     - frictionConstant, new Float(0.4f));
     - elasticConstant, new Float(0.5f));
     - punctualElasticConstant, new Float(1f));
     - eletrostaticConstant, new Float(1000f));
     - springSize, new Float(100));
     - nodeMass, new Float(5));
     - nodeCharge, new Float(1));
     - loadPageOnCenter, new Boolean(true));

These are not used anymore:

     - originX
     - originY
     - originZ
     - universeRadius
     - maxNodeSpeed
     - linkedNodesDistance

Changes:

[ADD] physical model to balance graph
[ADD] support for description box on mouse over
[ADD] Morcego and Arca logs, optional
[ADD] support for different transport layers, only XmlprcTransport available 
      by now
[ADD] option to have camera distance relative to nearest node instead of
      center, default.
[ADD] option to open target page on every navigation, default
[MOD] nodes pop always behind center node, to avoid hanging while rendering
      very big nodes
[FIX] graph instability in some cases
